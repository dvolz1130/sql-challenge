This directory is to store my files for the employee sql challenge
I used QuickDBD to design my ERD model, the only thing I couldn't figure out was how to create a FK that references two columns.
In my table_create.sql, I just added the DDL to create the FK on dept_manager called 'fk_dept_mang_emp'
